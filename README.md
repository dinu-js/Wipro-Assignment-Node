3 - http://localhost:3001/product?param1=5&param2=10 (to find product of param1 and param2)

4 - http://localhost:3001/repeating?input=aabbyhhj (to first non repeating character in given input)

5 - http://localhost:3001/upload (to upload a file to server)

    -> click choose a file button on browser
    
    -> click on submit
    
    -> if uploaded successfully message appears, file can be found in ./uploads folder of project directory

## Tools
